## Summary

This project contains a service that exposes data for a customers “My stock portfolio” screen (this service could also be used as part of an api offer).


## Observations
* The Free Rest API used does NOT have historic data so when queries are made then the value is of the current value (but with the amount of stock the customer has)
* No pagination






## TODO List

* ~~Working skeleton of non web project (improve knowledge of Spring Boot)~~  29 Jan
* Store on github 
* Create Repository for CSV and do “integration” testing for this using Apache CSV
* Code find prices with mock to give expectations for data
* Add SonarLint plugin
